== Requirements

- `name`: Required; validated by default in Laravel.
- `email`: Required; validated by default in Laravel to ensure format and uniqueness.
- `password`: Required; validated by default in Laravel for security standards.
- `last_name`: Required; no specific length constraints mentioned.
- `username`: Required; must be unique across users.
- `gender`: Required; must be one of the following predefined options: "Male", "Female", "Non-Binary".
- `country`: Required; will be handled via a dropdown select with an array of predefined countries.
- Other fields (`profile_photo`, `birthday`, `last_login`, `role`, `email_verified_at`, `remember_token`, `created_at`, `updated_at`): Currently no specific requirements or changes mentioned.
